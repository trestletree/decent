# Decent

A simple Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Elixir library, wrapping functions from the [pgp Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/pgp). Enables encrypting with a public key and decrypting with the corresponding private key.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `decent` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
